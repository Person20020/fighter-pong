A 2D platformer fighting game between a regular player and another using pong. You collect coins and try to kill your oppenent using either pong or upgrades bought using the coins.

Currently only the regular player is added and the pong part is not working.

The inspiration of this project is the many [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) commics that include strange combinations of games such as [#3139](https://xkcd.com/3139/), a combination of a sliding number puzzle and chess.

This is build using Godot. You can try it out on [itch.io](https://person20020.itch.io/fighter-pong).
